# Faster_RCNN_API 
Keras implementation of Faster R-CNN architecture: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks.

## NOTE: 
- REFER THE CORRESPONDING .py FILES FOR DETAILED DOCUMENTATION.  
- TERMINAL SUPPORT IS WITHDRAWN (In reference to yhenon's repo). USE THE SCRIPTS AS IMPORTABLE FUNCTIONS.
- THE CONFIGURATION FILE IS GENERATED BY THE [train_frcnn](https://github.com/Abhijit-2592/Keras_object_detection/blob/master/Faster_RCNN_API/train_frcnn.py) SCRIPT AUTOMATICALLY. THE [config.py](https://github.com/Abhijit-2592/Keras_object_detection/blob/master/Faster_RCNN_API/config.py) IS PRESENT JUST FOR LEGACY

## MAIN ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
- Both python-2 and python-3 are supported
- Support for Validation data
- Tensorboard logging of scalar quantities
- Support for four step alternating training
- Easy implementation of new feature extractors like inception-v2, mobilenet (Refer [nn_arch_vgg16.py](https://github.com/Abhijit-2592/Keras_object_detection/blob/master/Faster_RCNN_API/keras_frcnn/nn_arch_vgg16.py) to know how to implement a new architecture)
- The above functionality can be used to convert any classification model in keras into a object detection model using Faster-RCNN

## USAGE:
- Only tensorflow backend is supported. Since the compile time in thenao version is high I have removed the theano support.
- [train_frcnn](https://github.com/Abhijit-2592/Keras_object_detection/blob/master/Faster_RCNN_API/train_frcnn.py): Use for training the model
- The input data should be a text file in the following format

    filepath,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name`

    For example:

    /data/imgs/img_001.jpg,837,346,981,456,cow
    
    /data/imgs/img_002.jpg,215,312,279,391,cat

    The classes will be inferred from the file.
    
- [test_frcnn](https://github.com/Abhijit-2592/Keras_object_detection/blob/master/Faster_RCNN_API/test_frcnn.py) Use for testing the model on images
- [measure-map](https://github.com/Abhijit-2592/Keras_object_detection/blob/master/Faster_RCNN_API/measure_map.py) Use to measure the Mean Average Precision Metric
